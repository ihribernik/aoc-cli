// --- Part Two ---
// Realizing the error of his ways, Santa has switched to a better model of determining whether a string is naughty or nice.
// None of the old rules apply, as they are all clearly ridiculous.

// Now, a nice string is one with all of the following properties:

// It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping, like xyxy (xy) or aabcdefgaa (aa), but not like aaa (aa, but it overlaps).
// It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them, like xyx, abcdefeghi (efe), or even aaa.
// For example:

//qjhvhtzxzqqjkmpb is nice because is has a pair that appears twice (qj) and a letter that repeats with exactly one letter between them (zxz).
// xx yx x is nice because it has a pair that appears twice and a letter that repeats with one between, even though the letters used by each rule overlap.
// uurcxstgmygtbstg is naughty because it has a pair (tg) but no repeat with a single letter between them.
// ieodomkazucvgmuy is naughty because it has a repeating letter with one between (odo), but no pair that appears twice.
// How many strings are nice under these new rules?
